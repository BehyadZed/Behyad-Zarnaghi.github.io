During my course work of Deep Learning I gained auto tremandous expereince of neural nets and their vitality for classification matters. Moreover, I got familiar with generative models like autoencoders, variational auto encoders and GAN. Specifically the course work projects was:

* I have implemented an Autoencoder using fully connected network using pytorch frame work. the objective of this project was to regenerate MNIST digits. Moreover, to assess the this architectures performance, the encoder of the network was connected to a fully connected network for classifying the data produced with encoder. Using this way we can acknowledge that if the latent layer of the network has the essential data or not.

* I have worked with various kinds of CNN networks including inception network to classifying medical images. Inception network offers more accuracy than previous types of CNN since its stucture can avoid overfitting. To lower up the training costs of the models transfer learning concept has been exploited in which CNN layers were pretrained with the large and infamous ImageNet dataset. The learning process is only applied for the fully connected layers that classifies images. 

* In order to analyze natural language it is vital to use sequential networks which each cell structure gets corresponding information via subsequent cells. the most relevant models for this NLP are LSTM and GRU. both models can run over the overfitting trap and avoid redundant data information in training dataset. Additionaly, a hybrid model of both models was implemented to predct crypto currency prices.

* As the latest versions of generative models, GAN and VAE models has gained huge popularity. In the final assignment it was supposed to compare VAE with fully connected layers autoencoders and CNN based autoencoders. The latent layer of the VAE does not have deterministic data, making it more possible to generate high quality images.
