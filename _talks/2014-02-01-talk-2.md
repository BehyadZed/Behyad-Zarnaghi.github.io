As a junior mechanical engineer, I designed and assembled mechanisms such as sorters and gates for different parts which are involved in the final product of the company. Furthermore, I developed multiple codes in order to control servomotors, sensors, and actuators.

Specifically, I have designed pusher mechanisms using linear actuators to place certain parts in the insulin pen. which demanded high pushing forces. In order to control the actuators' movement, L298N motor driver was utilized. the actuator was stabilized inside a container which was fixed using aluminium profiles. A cone-shaped guide component was used at the tip of the actuator to guide the part to be oriented in a vertical pose while getting pushed to the pen. This piece was synthesized using 3D printing.

Additionally, a relevant gate was designed with acrylic glass to sort the gears in a way that either ring shares the same oring. A digital servo motor was used to move the arms of this 1 DOF gripper. Aluminium profiles were applied to stabilize the gripper as well.
